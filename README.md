Linux Display/Login Manager
===========================

This is a display/login manager for Linux, similar to GDM, KDM, or SLiM. It is a very simple display manager written in C using GTK3.

This display manager has only been tested on Arch Linux with `dwm` as the window manager. The window manager must be placed in `.xinitrc` (i.e. it should contain `exec dwm`).

You can find a tutorial for how to make this display manager [here](https://www.gulshansingh.com/posts/how-to-write-a-display-manager/). The [tutorial](https://github.com/gsingh93/display-manager/tree/tutorial) branch more closely follows the tutorial.
